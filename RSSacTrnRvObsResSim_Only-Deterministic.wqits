TSDataSet Name=RSSacTrnRv-ResSim Only-Deterministic
Description=Derived from RSSacTrnPO, but includes a rivers-only water quality geometry model with upstream boundaries at Keswick Dam and Whiskeytown Dam, and Lewiston Dam. ResSim will run the full 5-reservoir hydralics, so if alternative flows are desired ResSim overides must be used. (Obs WQ TS Data Set for ResSim Only-Deterministic)
