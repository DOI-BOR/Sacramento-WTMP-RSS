PDCDataSet Name=RSSacTrnRv-WAT-W2 5-Res Plus Rivers
Description=Derived from RSSacTrnPO, but includes a rivers-only water quality geometry model with upstream boundaries at Keswick Dam and Whiskeytown Dam, and Lewiston Dam. ResSim will run the full 5-reservoir hydralics, so if alternative flows are desired ResSim overides must be used. (PDC Data Set for WAT-W2 5-Res Plus Rivers)
